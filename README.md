## Running with Docker

    Or, I see you have some common sense

### NB - MinKNOW _must_ still be installed on the system that the docker container is run on!

### Quick start

```nu
git clone https://github.com/LooseLab/Icarust_docker.git
cd Icarust_docker
docker compose run --service-ports icarust
```


In order to run with docker, `docker engine > 3.20` and `docker compose` must be installed. Respective instructions for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository), and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository). The compose instructions are for linux alone, I believe that you need to install docker desktop for MacOS in order to have `compose`.

Whilst this is possible on Windows, linux and MacOS, I only have access to one of these OSs, and the volume bindings in the `docker-compose.yml` are linux specific. Pull requests welcome ðŸ‘€. See below in the volumes explanation for how to change this.

To run with simple defaults, enter the directory containing your docker-compose file and simply:

```bash
docker compose run --service-ports icarust
```
*NB.* The flag `--service-ports` opens up the ports on the docker container, so that the minKNOW API can connect. Otherwise, `docker compose run` ignores opening ports on the container.

Let's break down what happens here. The contents of [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) are as follows - 

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  icarust:
    image: adoni5/icarust:latest
    init: true
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: ./docker/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "10000:10000"
      - "10001:10001"
    volumes:
      - ./configs:/configs
      - /opt/ont/minknow/conf/rpc-certs:/opt/ont/minknow/conf/rpc-certs
      - ./squiggle_arrs:/squiggle_arrs
      - ./output:/tmp

```

So when we call docker compose run, the image listed at `adoni5/icarust:latest` is pulled, the required ports are exposed, and the required volumes are mounted. 

Ignoring the `build` section as out of context, (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/build/) if you wish to understand), this file effectively defines the icarust service. 

```yaml
icarust:
  image: adoni5/icarust:latest
  init: true
```

If the docker image for icarust is not found locally, one is pulled from hub.docker.com, from the adoni5/icarust repository. `init:true` means that icarust is run as the top level process, or `PID:1`. This allows it to respond to signals that are sent to the running container, such as `KeyboardInterrupt` to stop the process.

```yaml 
ports:
  - "10000:10000"
  - "10001:10001"
```

This exposes the ports 10000, and 10001 from inside the container to the host machine you are running docker on. The 10000 port is the port that the GRPC manager is running on, and the 10001 port is the port that the fake sequencing positions GRPC server is listening on. 

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./configs:/configs
  - /opt/ont/minknow/conf/rpc-certs:/opt/ont/minknow/conf/rpc-certs
  - ../squiggle_arrs:/squiggle_arrs
  - ./output:/tmp
```

This final section binds the listed directories on the left of the : of each line to the directories inside the container given on the right. This was the reasoning behind using compose to manage this container as it made the execution command much tidier. 

    - /configs contains the Simulation profile tomls and the config.ini file to pass parameters to the sequencer.
    - /opt/ont/minknow/conf/rpc-certs. This is the one that is hardcoded to linux at the moment. The problem here is that MinKNOW expects TLS secured GRPC connections, so we need to provide this, so MinKNOW must be installe don your system! Or the rpc-certs bundled with MinKNOw must be found at this location.
    - /sqiggle_arrs. Pregenerated squiggle must be placed here.
    - ./output:/tmp binds the host directory `output` to the `/tmp` directory in the container. This is where the squiggle is written to by default, so it is then available to the host system for analysis.

For a MacOS machine, it would suffice to change the certificate volume on the left of the : to the location the certficates are found. For example:

```bash
  - /Path/To/MacOS/MinKNOW/Certificates:/opt/ont/minknow/conf/rpc-certs
```

If the path is left the same as the right hand side of the colon in the `config.ini`, then you should still be golden!

## Pass different arguments to Icarust

The default arguments are defined in the main Icarust repo, in `docker/Dockerfile`. They are set in the Dockerfile, and are

```bash
-v -s /configs/config.toml
```

In order to change the Simulation Profile we are running, simply provide alternatives on the end of the `docker compose run icarust` command. For example: 

```bash
docker compose run icarust -vv -s /configs/<your_config_here>.toml
```

If you wish to change the number of channels or where the certificate path is located, these values can be edited in `configs/config.ini`. If the rpc certificates are changed, these will have to be changed to the respective values in the `docker-compose.yml`. For example if the certificates were changed to `/opt/ont/WinKNOW/what_certs`, the `docker-compose.yml` would become

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./configs:/configs
  - /opt/ont/WinKNOW/what_certs:/opt/ont/WinKNOW/what_certs
  - ../squiggle_arrs:/squiggle_arrs
  - ./output:/tmp

```

# Permission Shenanigans
By default the container runs with a User ID of 1000. If you are the primary user of this computer, this is likely to be you! This will not leave you with any problems. *However* If you are not the primary user, or you are running on a server with other user accounts on, you will not be able to wrtie out signal. In order to fix this, you can set the `--user` argument on the `docker compose run` command. 


| :zap:       Disclaimer, I have no idea how this works on windows!   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|

Find out who you are by running the `id` command on the command line.
Example output for ubuntu 20:
```bash
uid=997(adoni5) gid=1000(adoni5)```
```

So I can see here my user id is 997.
In order to run with permissions to interact with the output FAST5 files, you can run the starting command as:

```bash
docker compose run --user 997 --service-ports icarust [optional arguments to Icarust]
```
